# Project 4 Team Cushion
We evaluate a dataset for Wine with machine learning in mind, with the goal of making a model that can accuratley depict wine quality.

## Directory Layout

#### Visualizations - Contains vizualizations used for this project
* `CorrelationMatrix.png` A simple correlation matrix of the dataset
#### Visualizations - Were we put the kaggle.json api key, and will hold the connection strings for the sql server.
#### `SQLETL.ipynb` - Pulls data from Kaggle, and imports it to our PostgreSQL Neon server
#### `MachineLearning.ipynb` - The Jupyter Notebook for creating the model
